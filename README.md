To achieve a more balanced game, I changed the speed of the ghosts so the game is challenging but not impossible. 

Furthermore, I improved the Ghost AI so that when they reach a 3-way intersection, their direction is changed randomly. This makes their movement look more realistic and makes it harder for the pacman to hide from the ghosts.

The red dot serves as the special item, when the pacman eats the red dot it does not lose points when it gets caught by the ghost for the first time.
